# Gmail

Use Gmail to keep inboxes organized and communication moving.

## Capabilities

- Read/search messages and threads
- Draft and send replies
- Apply labels and update thread/message state
- Delete messages or threads when granted admin permissions

## Notes

- Use `users/me` when the caller does not specify a mailbox user.
- Prefer drafts before sending when content quality matters.
- Confirm destructive actions (deletes) with the user when possible.
