# Google Drive

Use Google Drive for file retrieval, organization, and sharing.

## Capabilities

- List/search files and folders
- Read file metadata and exported content
- Create/update/copy files and permissions
- Delete files or permissions when granted admin permissions

## Notes

- Use query filters to avoid scanning full drives unnecessarily.
- Prefer updating existing documents over creating duplicates unless asked otherwise.
- Confirm destructive actions (file deletes, trash emptying) with the user when possible.
